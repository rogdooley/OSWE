# OSWE & CWEE Practice Repository

This repository contains research material, exploit code, and utilities developed while preparing for the **Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE)** certification and the **Hack The Box Certified Web Exploitation Expert (CWEE)** course.

Some Python files in this repository were never intended to be standalone, executable scripts.  
This is especially true for the **Utilities** and **PythonExplorations** directories, which mostly contain experimental snippets kept on hand for future use.  
These snippets may require modification or debugging before use.

The repository was originally meant to be more comprehensive, but priorities shifted mid-development.  
Each directory corresponds to a topic or lab area explored while studying for web exploitation certifications.
